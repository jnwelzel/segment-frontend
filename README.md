This is the frontend part of the **Segmentation app exercise**. In order for it to work the backend (api) must also be accessible, either locally (at `http://localhost:8080` by default) or remotely (in this case you must set the `REACT_APP_PRODUCTION_API_URL` environment variable).

## Running locally
In your shell just use the `npm start` command and the application will start at `http://localhost:3000`.
